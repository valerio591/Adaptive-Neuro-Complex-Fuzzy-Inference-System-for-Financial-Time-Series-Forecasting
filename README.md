# Adaptive-Neuro-Complex-Fuzzy-Inference-System-for-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting
Master thesis project on the predictive capability of ANCFIS in a financial setting. ANCFIS is a neural network architecture inspired by complex fuzzy inference systems showing good performance in function approximation and chaotic time series prediction.

The thesis is available as a pdf file (Financial_Time_Series_Forecasting_with_ANCFIS.pdf)
